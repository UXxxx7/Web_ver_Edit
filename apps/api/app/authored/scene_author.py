"""M6 · SceneAuthor / FeedbackReviser —— 现写场景 + 看帧改代码(设计文档 §2.2/§2.6)。

实验脚本 arm_b_author_scene.py / arm_b_feedback.py 的产品化收敛:去 CLI 外壳,
输入输出变成干净的函数契约,LLM 传输层可注入(测试不联网,真调在用户机 smoke)。

两个入口:
    author_scene(ctx, llm_call=None)  -> AuthorResult   # 首次现写
    revise_scene(tsx, defects, ctx, notes="", llm_call=None) -> AuthorResult  # 修订
ctx = AuthorContext(transcript segments/words/duration、instruction、
                    example_images、broll 元数据、画幅)
defects 直接吃 M2 QAVerdict.defects 的形态({t0,t1,kind,desc,frame_path})——
M2 的输出就是本模块修订输入,契约咬合。

冻结提示:创作提示含第 8 条"全时间轴有效"通用不变量(黑屏事故后加的预防);
修订提示锁定"只修 bug、不重设计、Props 契约不变"。实验期间不按条微调。

传输层:llm_call(messages, max_tokens, temperature) -> {"content", "usage"}。
不传则用默认 requests 实现(AUTHOR_LLM_* 环境变量,回退仓库 VISION_LLM_* 配置)。
LLM 报错/超时不外抛 —— AuthorResult.ok=False + error,Orchestrator 靠返回值驱动。

计费:Gemini 思考型模型 total 含 thinking(按输出价计费),
billable_out = total - prompt。与实验期口径一致,便于成本对比。

AUTHORING_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a senior motion-graphics engineer. You write a SELF-CONTAINED Remotion composition (TypeScript/TSX) that edits ONE portrait talking-head video into a polished short — captions, tasteful motion, and b-roll inserts — bespoke for THIS video's content and the user's intent.

You are NOT filling a template or a fixed schema. You decide the layout, the animations, when and how b-roll appears, what on-screen text/cards to add, and their timing — grounded ONLY in what this transcript actually says and what the user asked for. Imitate the look/feel of the reference image(s) the user provides.

OUTPUT CONTRACT — the file you write MUST:
1. Be a single valid .tsx file, default-exporting a React component named `AuthoredScene`.
2. Import only from "react" and "remotion" (AbsoluteFill, OffthreadVideo, Sequence, useCurrentFrame, useVideoConfig, interpolate, spring, staticFile, Img). Do NOT import any project-local components or external libraries — everything self-contained, inline styles only. Every identifier you reference MUST be declared before use (no undefined identifiers / no typos in variable names — a single undeclared name like a mis-typed spring makes the whole render NaN/blank).
3. Read everything it needs from a single props object of THIS exact shape (already provided at render time — do not invent other props):
   type Props = {
     videoSrc: string;      // do NOT render this yourself — see rule 4
     sourceFrame: number;   // use THIS (not useCurrentFrame()) for all content timing — see rule 4
     broll: { src: string; label: string; startFrame: number; endFrame: number }[];
     words: { word: string; start: number; end: number }[];
     fps: number;
     durationInFrames: number;
     width: number; height: number;
   };
   The component signature is: `export const AuthoredScene: React.FC<Props> = (props) => { ... }` plus `export default AuthoredScene;`.
4. The base person video is ALREADY rendered for you, full-screen, behind your scene, by a wrapper component you never see — do NOT render it yourself. Your output must NOT contain an `<OffthreadVideo>`, `<Video>`, or any element with `src={videoSrc}` / `src={props.videoSrc}` anywhere — your scene draws ONLY the overlay layer (b-roll, captions, graphic cards) on top of that already-playing base. This matters even more than it looks: a scene that renders its own copy of the base video reliably crashes the actual server render entirely (confirmed — two elements requesting the same video source at once makes Remotion's renderer fail outright, not just look wrong), not merely a cosmetic double-render. For ALL content timing (b-roll windows, caption sync, graphic-card triggers) declare `const frame = props.sourceFrame;` once near the top and use `frame` exactly as you would have before — do NOT call `useCurrentFrame()` for this (that value shifts once a viewer makes a mid-video cut later; `sourceFrame` doesn't). During a b-roll window, show that b-roll prominently — landscape b-roll must NOT be side-cropped; contain it and fill the rest with a blurred copy of the same frame. B-ROLL PLAYBACK TIMING (critical): a b-roll clip must play from ITS OWN first frame when its window opens. Wrap every b-roll <OffthreadVideo> in <Sequence from={startFrame} durationInFrames={endFrame - startFrame}> (Sequence is already allowed from "remotion") so its internal clock resets to 0 at the window start. Do NOT put a b-roll <OffthreadVideo> bare on the timeline: a bare OffthreadVideo is mapped to the ABSOLUTE composition frame, so any clip shorter than the window's start time freezes on its last frame.
5. Burn in captions from `words`, grouped into short readable phrases in sync with the spoken words. Keep them legible (safe-area bottom third, high contrast). CAPTION STABILITY (critical, recurring bug): FIRST build a FIXED array of phrase groups by splitting `words` at pauses (gap > ~0.35s between consecutive words) or every ~6-8 words; THEN for each group display its FULL joined text continuously from the group's first-word start frame to its last-word end frame. NEVER recompute the caption each frame by filtering `words` to the one(s) whose [start,end] contains the current instant — that makes the subtitle flicker word-by-word. The visible caption text MUST stay constant within a phrase and change only at phrase boundaries.
6. Add a few — not many — on-screen graphic beats ONLY where the transcript genuinely warrants one, anchored to the words being spoken. Match the reference image's aesthetic.
7. Use spring()/interpolate() for entrances; nothing pops in hard. Everything deterministic from `frame` (= `props.sourceFrame`; no Date/random).
8. WHOLE-TIMELINE VALIDITY (critical, general): every visual state must be correct across the ENTIRE duration, not only inside the window it was designed for. For any element whose state changes around a b-roll window (e.g. the person shrinking into a PiP inset), explicitly define its state for BEFORE, DURING, and AFTER that window. An inset/PiP that shrinks the person MUST default to person-fills-the-card whenever no b-roll is active — never leave a card or container showing only its (black) background. Concretely: do NOT gate a transition on a single spring whose value before its trigger frame yields the wrong state (e.g. `1 - spring(frame - endFrame)` is 1 before the window starts). Prefer building progress as (enterSpring at windowStart − exitSpring at windowEnd) so it is 0 before, 1 during, 0 after. Mentally trace frame 0, mid-clip, and the final frame and confirm every region shows real content.
9. GRAPHIC/B-ROLL TIMING COORDINATION (critical, recurring bug): a b-roll fills the frame for its whole [startFrame, endFrame] window (rule 4) and covers everything beneath it. So NEVER let an on-screen graphic beat (card/stat/quote/overlay) be visible ONLY during a b-roll window, or only in a short sliver right after one — that renders as a card that flashes in and instantly vanishes (the single most-reported "looks bad" defect). Every graphic beat MUST get at least ~45 frames (≈1.5s at 30fps) of UNOBSTRUCTED visible time — time when no b-roll is covering it. When a beat sits next to a b-roll window, place its whole visible window either fully BEFORE that b-roll's startFrame or fully AFTER its endFrame; do NOT overlap it with the b-roll and count the covered frames as "shown". If a beat cannot get its ~1.5s of unobstructed time (e.g. the transcript moment it anchors to is buried inside a b-roll window), move it just past the b-roll's endFrame or drop it — never emit a sub-second flash.

Return ONLY the raw .tsx file content. No markdown fences, no prose, no explanation."""

REVISION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a senior motion-graphics engineer REVISING an existing Remotion composition (AuthoredScene.tsx) that you wrote earlier. You are shown DEFECTS detected on its ACTUAL RENDER (machine-scanned regions and/or user notes, with captured frames), plus the current code. Fix the specific defects. This is a debugging pass, not a rewrite.

RULES:
1. KEEP everything that already works (layout, colors, captions, the reference look). Change ONLY what the defects show to be broken. Do not restyle or re-theme.
2. The frames are ground truth. A common bug: a state/animation gate is inverted or only handles the AFTER case, so a section (e.g. BEFORE a b-roll window) shows a blank/black card or a mis-sized element. For BEFORE/DURING/AFTER each window, reason what each region SHOULD show. A PiP that shrinks the person must default to person-fills-the-card when no b-roll is active — `1 - spring(frame - endFrame)` is 1 before the window and wrongly shrinks the person from frame 0; rebuild as (enterSpring at start − exitSpring at end). Treat each machine-flagged region as a confirmed defect.
3. The Props contract is UNCHANGED and fixed: `videoSrc`, `sourceFrame`, `broll`, `words`, `fps`, `durationInFrames`, `width`, `height`. `export const AuthoredScene: React.FC<Props>` + `export default AuthoredScene;`. Import only from "react" and "remotion". Self-contained, deterministic from `props.sourceFrame` — NOT `useCurrentFrame()` for content timing (sourceFrame is what stays correct once a viewer makes a mid-video cut; useCurrentFrame() doesn't). B-ROLL PLAYBACK TIMING: every b-roll <OffthreadVideo> MUST be wrapped in <Sequence from={startFrame} durationInFrames={endFrame - startFrame}> so the clip plays from its own start, never the absolute composition frame (a bare b-roll OffthreadVideo freezes on its last frame once the window starts past the clip length).
4. Landscape b-roll never side-cropped (contain + blurred fill). The base person video is rendered by a wrapper OUTSIDE your scene, already full-screen behind it — your scene must NEVER render its own `<OffthreadVideo>`/`<Video>` with `src={videoSrc}` (or `props.videoSrc}`). IF THE RENDER YOU'RE FIXING PRODUCED ZERO FRAMES / CRASHED IMMEDIATELY (not a visual defect, a hard failure): check for exactly this FIRST — a leftover base-video element is the single most common cause, because it makes two elements request the same video source at once and reliably crashes the real server render. Remove it entirely; do not just swap which video component renders it. Captions stay in sync from `words`. Preserve the timing, windows, and transitions of EXISTING b-roll inserts unless a flagged defect or the user's notes require changing them — do NOT restyle, re-time, or flatten working b-roll as a side effect of another fix.
5. GRAPHIC/B-ROLL TIMING COORDINATION: if a defect (or user note) is a card/graphic that flashes in and vanishes almost immediately — appearing right as a b-roll ends and gone ~1s later — the cause is a graphic beat scheduled to be visible only during, or only in a sliver right after, a full-frame b-roll window that covered it. Fix it by moving that beat's whole visible window to be fully AFTER the b-roll's endFrame (or fully BEFORE its startFrame) with at least ~45 frames (≈1.5s at 30fps) of unobstructed on-screen time; if it can't get that, drop it rather than leave a sub-second flash. Do not otherwise re-time working beats.
6. Return ONLY the full corrected .tsx file content — the entire file, not a diff, no markdown fences, no prose."""

# 架构复审后新增（2026-07-29）：这里原来是自己重新写的一份 requests.post(
# timeout=240)，跟同一晚在 llm_client.py 里整晚在修的 DeepSeek 传输层是完全
# 独立的第二套实现，没有分享任何加固：
#   - timeout=240 只保证单次 socket 读取不超时，服务器间歇挤字节的话照样能
#     拖到几分钟甚至更久——跟 llm_client._post_with_retries 改之前一模一样
#     的漏洞（真实事故：DeepSeek 侧同一类调用实测卡过 17 分钟）。
#   - 每次都新开一条连接，没有复用。
# 复用 llm_client._post_bounded（后台线程 + 硬性总耗时上限，不管服务器怎么
# "挤牙膏"到点就不再等；同时带上模块级 Session 连接复用）——请求体构造/
# AUTHOR_LLM_*/VISION_LLM_* 配置回退/响应解析都不动，纯传输层换血。
#
# 硬上限**没有**直接沿用 llm_client 自己的默认值（75s，是按 DeepSeek 非流式
# 网关 ~60s 硬时限、纯 JSON 内容规划这类调用的实际时长调的）——这里的调用
# 现写/修订的是真实场景代码（MAX_TOKENS=32000，思考型模型自带 thinking
# token），明显是更重的调用，硬套一个为不同工作量调的数字，会把本该成功、
# 只是本来就需要更久的调用提前误杀，那不是这个机制原本要防的问题（防的是
# "服务器挤牙膏导致单次调用无限期卡住"，不是"限制所有调用必须多快完成"）。
# 用 `_post_bounded` 新增的 `hard_deadline_s` 参数传回原来这里的 240，保留
